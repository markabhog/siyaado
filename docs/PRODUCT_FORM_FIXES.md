# Product Form Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **1. Product Tags Not Accepting Spaces**

**Problem:**
- Tags like "Best Seller" were being split incorrectly
- Spaces within tag names were not preserved

**Solution:**
- Updated tag parsing to split only by commas
- Spaces within tags are now preserved
- Added visual tag preview with delete buttons

**Before:**
```
Input: "Best Seller, Editor's Choice"
Result: ["Best", "Seller", "Editor's", "Choice"] ❌
```

**After:**
```
Input: "Best Seller, Editor's Choice"
Result: ["Best Seller", "Editor's Choice"] ✅
```

**New Features:**
- ✅ Tags preview below input field
- ✅ Delete button (×) for each tag

### **2. Unclear Required Field Validation**

**Problem:**
- Generic "required fields missing" error
- No indication of which fields were missing
- Confusing for users

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive validation with specific error messages
- Lists exactly which required fields are missing
- Validates category-specific required fields

**New Validation Checks:**
1. ✅ SKU → "Please enter a SKU"
2. ✅ Title → "Please enter a product title"
3. ✅ Price → "Please enter a valid price"
4. ✅ Stock → "Please enter a valid stock quantity"
5. ✅ Images → "Please upload at least one product image"
6. ✅ Categories → "Please select at least one category"
7. ✅ Category-specific required fields → Lists missing fields by name

**Example Error Messages:**

```
❌ Before:
"Required fields are missing"

✅ After (Books):
"Please fill in the following required fields:

Author"

✅ After (Phones):
"Please fill in the following required fields:

Brand
Model"

✅ After (Laptops):
"Please fill in the following required fields:

Brand

```
